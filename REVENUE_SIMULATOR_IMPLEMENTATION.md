- **`SimulationRepository`** - JPA repository with custom queries
- **`SimulationService`** - Business logic service
- **`SimulationController`** - REST API controller

### 4. Calculations & Formulas

#### Implemented Formulas:

- **Gross Revenue** = `quantity × pricePerKg`
- **Total Expenses** = `transportCosts + otherCosts`
- **Net Revenue** = `grossRevenue - totalExpenses`
- **Profit Margin** = `(netRevenue / grossRevenue) × 100`

#### Features:

- ✅ Real-time calculations
- ✅ Automatic profit margin calculation
- ✅ Color-coded results based on profitability
- ✅ Validation with reasonable limits

### 5. UI/UX Features

- ✅ History displayed as organized list with dates
- ✅ Offline status indicators
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Sample data button for testing

#### Responsive Design:

- ✅ Mobile-first approach
- ✅ Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- ✅ Touch-friendly form controls
- ✅ Optimized for small screens

## 🚀 How to Use

### Frontend Access:

1. Navigate to `/simulator` route in the app
2. Fill in the simulation form:
   - Quantity (kg)
   - Price per kg (FCFA)
   - Transport costs (FCFA)
   - Other costs (FCFA)
3. View real-time calculations
4. Save simulation to history
5. Access saved simulations from the history panel

### Offline Mode:

- Works completely offline
- Simulations are stored locally in IndexedDB
- Automatic sync when connection is restored
- Clear offline status indicators

### Backend API:

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Simulations are user-specific
- Automatic calculation of derived fields
- Comprehensive error handling

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Technologies Used:

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, IndexedDB
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3, JPA/Hibernate, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Validation**: Bean Validation (Jakarta)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with computed columns

### Key Features:

- **Offline-First**: Works without internet connection
- **Real-Time**: Instant calculations and updates

- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

## 📊 Database Design

The `simulations` table uses computed columns for automatic calculations:

- `gross_revenue` = `quantity * price_per_kg`
- `total_expenses` = `transport_costs + other_costs`
- `net_revenue` = `gross_revenue - total_expenses`

This ensures data consistency and reduces application complexity.
