# English Translation Fix - React Error

## Problem Identified

When changing language from Portuguese to English, the application generated the following error:

```
Uncaught Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {region, quality, dateFrom, dateTo, verified, apply, clear})
```

## Root Cause

The problem was in the structure of the English translation file (`en.json`):

1. **`prices.filters` key incorrectly structured**: It was defined as an object instead of a string
2. **Missing keys**: Several translation keys were not present in the English file
3. **Structural inconsistency**: The structure of the English file differed from the Portuguese file

### Incorrect Structure (Before)

```json
"prices": {
  "filters": {
    "region": "Select region",
    "quality": "Select quality",
    "dateFrom": "Date from",
    "dateTo": "Date to",
    "verified": "Verified only",
    "apply": "Apply filters",
    "clear": "Clear filters"
  }
}
```

### Correct Structure (After)

```json
"prices": {
  "filters": "Filters",
  "clearFilters": "Clear All",
  "allRegions": "All Regions",
  "allQualities": "All Qualities",
  "allPrices": "All Prices",
  "verifiedOnly": "Verified Only",
  "unverifiedOnly": "Unverified Only",
  "searchPlaceholder": "Search by source name...",
  "selectRegion": "Select region",
  "selectQuality": "Select quality",
  "dateFrom": "From date",
  "dateTo": "To date",
  "sortBy": {
    "date": "Date Recorded",
    "price": "Price",
    "submitted": "Date Submitted"
  },
  "sortDir": {
    "desc": "Newest First",
    "asc": "Oldest First"
  },
  "showing": "Showing",
  "of": "of",
  "results": "results",
  "previous": "Previous",
  "next": "Next",
  "page": "Page",
  "noPrices": "No prices found",
  "noPricesDescription": "Try adjusting your filters or submit the first price.",
  "recordedOn": "Recorded on",
  "by": "by",
  "errorLoading": "Failed to load prices. Please try again.",
  "filterOptions": {
    "region": "Select region",
    "quality": "Select quality",
    "dateFrom": "Date from",
    "dateTo": "Date to",
    "verified": "Verified only",
    "apply": "Apply filters",
    "clear": "Clear filters"
  }
}
```

## Affected Component

The error occurred in the `PriceList.tsx` component at line 174:

```tsx
<h3 className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
  {t("prices.filters", "Filters")}
</h3>
```

The `useTranslation` hook was returning an object instead of a string, causing the React error.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Restructuring the `prices.filters` key

- Changed from object to string
- Moved filter options to `filterOptions`

### 2. Adding missing keys

- `clearFilters`
- `allRegions`
- `allQualities`
- `allPrices`
- `verifiedOnly`
- `unverifiedOnly`
- `searchPlaceholder`
- `selectRegion`
- `selectQuality`
- `dateFrom`
- `dateTo`
- `sortBy.*`
- `sortDir.*`
- `showing`
- `of`
- `results`
- `previous`
- `next`
- `page`
- `noPrices`
- `noPricesDescription`
- `recordedOn`
- `by`
- `errorLoading`

### 3. Structural consistency

- Alignment with Portuguese file structure
- Maintaining React component compatibility

## Modified Files

- `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en.json`

## Validation Test

1. Start the frontend application
2. Go to the prices page
3. Change language from Portuguese to English
4. Verify no more "Objects are not valid as a React child" error
5. Verify all texts are correctly translated

## Prevention

To avoid this type of problem in the future:

1. **Structural consistency**: Maintain the same structure across all translation files
2. **Type validation**: Ensure keys used in components match expected types
3. **Translation testing**: Systematically test language changes on all pages
4. **Documentation**: Document expected structure of translation files

## Impact

- ✅ React error fixed
- ✅ Language change functional
- ✅ User interface fully translated to English
- ✅ Consistency with other languages
- ✅ Maintained filter functionality

## Comparison with French Fix

This fix follows the same pattern as the French translation fix:

- Both had the same structural issue with `prices.filters`
- Both required adding missing translation keys
- Both maintain the same component compatibility
- Both follow the Portuguese file structure as reference
